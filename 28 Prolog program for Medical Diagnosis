% Rules: defining a diagnosis based on symptoms
has_disease(Patient, Disease) :-
    patient_symptoms(Patient, Symptoms),
    disease(Disease, DiseaseSymptoms),
    subset(DiseaseSymptoms, Symptoms).

% Check if a list is a subset of another list
subset([], _).
subset([H|T], List) :-
    member(H, List),
    subset(T, List).

% Example queries to set patient symptoms
% patient_symptoms(Patient, [Symptoms])
patient_symptoms(john, [fever, headache, cough, sore_throat, runny_nose, sneezing]).
patient_symptoms(mary, [runny_nose, sneezing, cough, sore_throat]).
patient_symptoms(alex, [fever, cough, shortness_of_breath, fatigue, loss_of_taste, loss_of_smell]).
patient_symptoms(lisa, [sneezing, runny_nose, itchy_eyes, headache]).

% Example queries
% To diagnose a patient:
% ?- has_disease(john, Disease).
% Disease = flu.

% ?- has_disease(mary, Disease).
% Disease = cold.

% ?- has_disease(alex, Disease).
% Disease = covid19.

% ?- has_disease(lisa, Disease).
% Disease = allergy.
